# FDA Structure/Function Claims vs. Disease Claims

## Overview
Dietary supplements may make structure/function claims but are prohibited from making disease claims.

## Structure/Function Claims
Structure/function claims describe the role of a nutrient or dietary ingredient intended to affect the structure or function of the human body.
- **Example:** "Calcium builds strong bones."
- **Requirement:** Must be truthful and not misleading. Must include the disclaimer: "This statement has not been evaluated by the Food and Drug Administration. This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease."

## Disease Claims
Disease claims state or imply that a product can diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent a disease. These are **prohibited** for dietary supplements.
- **Prohibited Example:** "Cures cancer."
- **Prohibited Example:** "Prevents the flu."
- **Prohibited Example:** "Treats arthritis pain."
- **Prohibited Example:** "Lowers cholesterol" (implies treating hypercholesterolemia).

## Cosmetic Claims
Cosmetics can only claim to beautify, cleanse, promote attractiveness, or alter appearance.
- **Allowed:** "Reduces the appearance of wrinkles."
- **Prohibited:** "Removes wrinkles" (implies a structural change).
- **Prohibited:** "Stimulates collagen production" (drug claim).

## Evidence Requirements
All claims must be substantiated by competent and reliable scientific evidence.
- **Truthful and Not Misleading:** Claims must be supported by data.
- **Consumer Perception:** Claims are evaluated based on how a reasonable consumer would understand them.
